This mod will aim to add basic automation into standard part.
The first one is the auto raise/lower landing gear for plane.

ModuleManager is required but not included in the download, please download it from [here](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219)

**AutoGear and AutoLeg:**

The Gear action group act as a global switch for the automation.

**Off:** Raise all your gear and turn off the mod.

**On :** Turn on the mod.

Your landing gear will now retract or extend when your altitude go over some threshold.
The threshold are customizable in an editor windows.

Your Solar panel will automatically retract or extend depending on the atmospheric density and your speed.
It won't extend inside a fairing.
