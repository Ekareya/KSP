This mod will aim to add basic automation into standard part.
The first one is the auto raise/lower landing gear for plane.

**AutoGear and AutoLeg:**

The Gear action group act as a global switch for the automation.

**Off:** Raise all your gear and turn off the mod.

**On :** Turn on the mod.

Your landing gear will now retract or extend when your altitude go over some threshold.
The threshold are customizable in an editor windows.


**AutoDeploy:**

Your Solar panel will automatically retract or extend depending on the atmospheric density and your speed.
It won't extend inside a fairing.

**TODO:**

- Auto Fairing deployement in space
- Auto turn off surface control in space
- Auto decouple on empty tank
